    WARNING: The script flask is installed in '/Users/nolan/Library/Python/3.9/bin' which

    use --no-warn-script-location.

    WARNING: The directory '/Users/nolan/Library/Caches/pip' or its parent directory is not
    owned or is not writable by the current user. The cache has been disabled. Check the 
    permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you should use sudo's -H flag.

    WARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting 
    behaviour with the system packagemanager. It is recommended to use a virtual environment 
    instead: https://pip.pypa.io/warnings/venv
